# Laravel Blog Project

This is going to be my personal blog, which I was planning to build some time ago. 
Of course I will leave it open source to even copy, use it as yours and/or develop it further.

I am planning to make it full stack which I would be happy to use React.js(next.js) on the front and for the back a SQL DB with Laravel to make all the "routes". Simply to practice and use it as my actual Blog.


## Demo



Not yet enough progress to actually make it live. -> >10%
## Documentation

[Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x)
is your place to go! Also I would suggest visiting [https://laracasts.com/] for further education about laravel.
